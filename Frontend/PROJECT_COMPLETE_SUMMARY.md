## System Architecture

### Authentication Flow:
1. User logs in via `Login.js`
2. Token stored securely in localStorage
3. All API calls include authentication headers
4. Automatic redirect to login on auth failure

### Verification System:
1. Users apply for verification via `verification.html`
2. Admin reviews applications with document verification
3. Verification status displayed across all pages via badge system
4. Universal detection works with any backend verification pattern

### Recipe System:
1. Enhanced API handles all recipe operations
2. Ingredient parsing and search optimization
3. Meal suggestions based on available ingredients
4. Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
